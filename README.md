Advanced Programming

These are some of my codes related to Advanced Programming Course.

At the following you can find the steps needed to create a repository and pushing your projects using git and Visual Studio Code

Create a directory on the local file system.
Create a repo on Github.
Select Clone "Clone or download" on Github, copy the link
In Visual Studio Code, sect File -> Add Folder to Workspace -> Select the newly created directory
Select Terminal Window
In the window, type:
git config --global user.name <github userID>
git clone <URL from github link copied earlier>

git config --global user.name
git clone https://github.com/mamintoosi/cpp.git

File/Open Folder, open cpp
CPP [WSL] new file, create helloworld.cpp

On Terminal:
git commit -m "First commit"
git push -u origin master
and enter your user and passwords

Now you have helloworld.cpp on your github repository :)

After that I added this Readme to repository from github web
